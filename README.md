Implementing a Lox compiler/interpreter in Java (jlox), C (clox) and eventually C++ and Rust maybe.
Closely following this book: http://craftinginterpreters.com/

## Build

To build __jlox__, run `ant compile jar` inside `jlox/` folder and the executable jar file will be in `jlox/build/jar/Lox.jar`.
To build __clox__, run `make` inside `clox/` folder and the executable file will be in `clox/clox`.
